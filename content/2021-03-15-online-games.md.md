I rarely play online games because lag pisses me off. I've been hearing for some time now that modern online games are super fun and have very little lag so I decided to play some 2K21 online and see for myself the _miracle_ of lagless online gaming.

## how did it go?

a fucking nightmare. playing 2K21 online is a shitty experience and will make you want to die. the lag in the shooting indicator while shooting 3s or free throws is just as  annoying as I expected it to be.

## conclusion

fuck online games.
