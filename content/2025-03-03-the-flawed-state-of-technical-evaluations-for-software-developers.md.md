Technical evaluations for software developers, especially senior roles, often miss the mark by focusing on irrelevant skills like memorizing acronyms (e.g., SOLID) and solving competitive programming puzzles (e.g., reversing a binary tree). These exercises, rooted in academia, test recall and algorithmic trivia rather than the real-world abilities—system design, collaboration, debugging—crucial to the job. For senior developers, who rarely implement obscure algorithms but frequently tackle complex, practical challenges, this disconnect is particularly glaring. The result? A frustrating process that rewards test-taking over competence, alienating experienced candidates and leaving employers with hires misaligned to their needs.

Real-world scenarios—like debugging production code or discussing trade-offs—would better assess relevant skills, yet many companies cling to standardized, outdated methods for convenience. This wastes time and risks overlooking talent adept at the messy reality of development but not at whiteboard stunts. The fix? Shift to practical assessments—take-home projects, pair programming, system design discussions—that mirror the job, ensuring evaluations find developers who can truly excel, not just ace a trivia quiz.
